# Deploying as a remote MCP server

The stdio server in `src/index.ts` only works on the machine it runs on. To use
these tools from claude.ai or the Claude mobile app, deploy the Worker in
`src/worker/` to Cloudflare and add it as a custom connector.

The Worker holds the YNAB token server-side and puts GitHub sign-in in front of
it, restricted to a single GitHub account. These are separate layers:
GitHub sign-in controls who may connect, while the YNAB Personal Access Token
controls which YNAB account the server reaches. They answer different
questions, and neither substitutes for the other. The Worker uses one
server-wide YNAB token, so anyone admitted through GitHub reaches the
deployer's YNAB account, money, and every plan available to that token—not
their own YNAB account.
`ynab_list_plans` lists all of those plans, and a caller-supplied `planId`
overrides the optional `YNAB_PLAN_ID` default. That matters: the tool set
includes create, update and delete, so an unauthenticated endpoint would let
anyone who finds the URL rewrite those plans.

## One-time setup

### 1. Create your local Wrangler config and log in

The repository provides a template; the real config is git-ignored because it
contains your account-specific KV namespace ID.

```bash
cp wrangler.example.jsonc wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler login
```

### 2. Create the KV namespace for OAuth grants

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
```

Copy the printed `id` into your local `wrangler.jsonc`, replacing
`REPLACE_WITH_KV_NAMESPACE_ID`. Do not edit `wrangler.example.jsonc` with your
account-specific value.

### 3. Create a GitHub OAuth app

At <https://github.com/settings/developers> → **New OAuth App**:

- **Homepage URL**: `https://ynab-mcp-server.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://ynab-mcp-server.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback`

You get the exact hostname after the first `npm run deploy`; deploy once, then
fill these in and update them if the name changes.

### 4. Set deployment values and secrets

Run each command and paste the value when prompted. Keep deployment-specific
values out of `wrangler.jsonc`; Wrangler stores them remotely on the Worker.
Only the GitHub username stored in `ALLOWED_GITHUB_LOGIN` can complete sign-in.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ALLOWED_GITHUB_LOGIN
npx wrangler secret put YNAB_API_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Optionally pin a default plan so tool calls can omit `planId`:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put YNAB_PLAN_ID
```

`YNAB_BUDGET_ID` is deprecated but still accepted as an alias; there is no
removal date. Use `YNAB_PLAN_ID` for new deployments.

Set the operator-owned OpenRouter API key (used to call TypeSafe Jev) as a Worker secret:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Category suggestions remain off unless you also add
`"YNAB_AI_CATEGORIZATION": "true"` under `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc`. Both
settings are required to expose `ynab_suggest_categories`; the key never
belongs in `wrangler.jsonc` or a tool argument.

### 6. Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Add the connector in Claude

1. claude.ai → Settings → Connectors → **Add custom connector**
2. Name: `YNAB`
3. URL: `https://ynab-mcp-server.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp`
4. Connect, and complete the GitHub sign-in when prompted

Once connected it works everywhere you are signed in to Claude, including the
mobile app. Your Mac does not need to be running.

## Categorize reminders (optional)

The Worker can drop a reminder on a Google Calendar when transactions are
waiting to be categorized. It runs hourly and acts once a day, in the local
hour you choose. With no service account configured the job is a no-op, so this
is entirely opt-in.

### 1. Create a service account

In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate):

1. Create a project, then enable the
   [Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
2. APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → Service account
3. On the new account, Keys → Add key → Create new key → JSON

A service account avoids the usual OAuth dance: there are no refresh tokens to
store and no consent screen, because access comes from sharing the calendar
with it directly.

### 2. Share the calendar with it

In Google Calendar, open the calendar's settings → "Share with specific people
or groups" → add the service account's email with **Make changes to events**.

### 3. Configure and deploy

Set the deployment-specific calendar ID and service-account key as Worker
secrets. Configure `NAG_TIMEZONE`, the `NAG_HOUR_MIN`/`NAG_HOUR_MAX` window,
and `NAG_SINCE_DAYS` in `wrangler.jsonc` if their defaults do not suit you:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put NAG_CALENDAR_ID
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON < service-account.json
npm run deploy
```

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NAG_CALENDAR_ID` | — | Calendar to write to. Unset disables the job. |
| `NAG_TIMEZONE` | `America/Los_Angeles` | IANA zone the reminder is scheduled in |
| `NAG_HOUR_MIN` | `8` | Earliest local hour the event may land on |
| `NAG_HOUR_MAX` | `20` | Latest local hour, inclusive. Set equal to the minimum for a fixed time. |

### How it behaves

- **Nothing pending, no event.** The reminder only exists when there is work.
- **A different hour each day.** The slot is drawn from the configured window,
  derived from the date so that every hourly run agrees on it — a per-run
  random draw would fire several times some days and never on others.
- **One event per day.** The event id is derived from the date, so a re-run
  updates that day's event rather than stacking duplicates.
- **The count is the current month.** It resets on the 1st, so the month you
  are budgeting is the month you are reminded about. Anything older is a
  footnote in the description, not the headline.
- **Transfers are ignored.** Moving money between your own accounts shows up
  as uncategorized in YNAB but never needs a category. In the plan this was
  built against, 77 of 80 "uncategorized" items were transfer legs.
- **The wording rotates daily.** Same mechanism as the hour: derived from the
  date, so it is stable within a day and different the next.
- **Daylight saving is handled.** Cloudflare crons are UTC, so the job runs
  hourly and acts only in the configured local hour, holding its wall-clock
  slot year round.

## TypeSafe category preview (optional)

When enabled as described above, `ynab_suggest_categories` proposes categories
for eligible uncategorized outflows. It is a preview only and never writes to
YNAB. Applying a proposal requires a separate explicit write; see
[Category suggestions](./README.md#category-suggestions-optional) for the apply
tool and its safeguards.

The request sends display payee and imported/original payee text, memo, amount,
date, account name/type/on-budget status, and visible category group/category
names to **OpenRouter, which routes it to TypeSafe; both act as third-party
processors**. It does not send YNAB UUIDs,
balances, goals, cleared/approved flags, or raw payee history. The tool uses the
pinned `typesafe/jev-1.13` model through OpenRouter's System One endpoint. Its published price at the time of writing is $0.042
per million input tokens with output free; provider pricing and limits can
change. Each tool response reports preflight estimates, actual token usage,
and the projected cost. The implementation defaults to 20 rows, caps calls at
100 rows, batches ten questions, and refuses oversized request/cost estimates.

The evaluation behind this opt-in was synthetic and single-evaluator (98.3%
exact labels, 98.9% top-three, and 60/60 expected abstentions over 40 unique
fixtures). That supports a narrow preview, not default-on categorization or
AI-triggered writes.

## Read-only mode

To expose only the tools that read data and none that change it, set
`YNAB_READ_ONLY` to `"true"` in `wrangler.jsonc` and redeploy. The write tools
disappear from `tools/list` entirely rather than failing when called. The
TypeSafe preview is registered as read-only and remains available in this mode
only when both its feature flag and secret are configured.

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

Uses `.dev.vars` for secrets (git-ignored). The OAuth flow needs a real GitHub
app to complete end to end; without one you can still exercise the unauthorized
paths and the OAuth metadata endpoints.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/registry.ts` | The one tool list, shared by both entry points |
| `src/index.ts` | stdio entry (local Claude Code / Claude Desktop) |
| `src/worker/index.ts` | Worker entry: OAuth in front of the MCP handler |
| `src/worker/mcp.ts` | Builds the MCP server and serves `/mcp` |
| `src/worker/github-handler.ts` | GitHub sign-in and the single-user gate |

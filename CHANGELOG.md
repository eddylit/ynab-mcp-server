## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `ynab_suggest_categories` now calls `typesafe/jev-1.13` through OpenRouter's System One endpoint. Replace `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (env var or Worker secret).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Added the opt-in read-only `ynab_suggest_categories` preview tool with TypeSafe Jev eligibility rules and skip summaries.
- Added `ynab_apply_category_suggestions` for explicit, guarded bulk application with dry-run and undo manifests.
- Added MCP tool annotations.
- Added plan-named tools `ynab_list_plans` and `ynab_plan_summary` with `planId` and `YNAB_PLAN_ID`.

### Changed
- Upgraded the `ynab` SDK from 2.10 to 4.5, including its budget-to-plan internal rename.
- Reported tool failures as MCP error results and restored field descriptions in advertised schemas.
- Used YNAB enums for create-transaction cleared/flagColor values, including reconciled and flag clearing.
- Tightened input validation, allowed null optional inputs, and pinned the MCP inspector dev dependency.

### Deprecated
- `ynab_list_budgets`, `ynab_budget_summary`, `budgetId`, and `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` remain accepted aliases. `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` is deprecated and still accepted, with no removal date stated.

### Fixed
- Fixed transaction-listing filter argument order after the SDK upgrade.
- Accepted empty or null `transactionIds`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- Verified compatibility across Node.js 22, 24, and 26 in the CI matrix. Node.js 22 reaches end of life on April 30, 2027, and Node.js 24 reaches end of life on April 30, 2028, according to the Node.js release schedule.
- Bumped `@types/node` to the Node.js 22 line.
- Credited the 0.2.0 release contributors by GitHub username and profile URL.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Added money movement, auto-assignment, spending-by-category and spending-by-payee reporting, and cash-flow reporting tools.
- Added account and category name matching for transaction creation, including near-miss feedback and matched-name echoes.
- Added a Cloudflare Worker remote entry point with GitHub OAuth and a read-only deployment mode.
- Added tools for listing categories, accounts, scheduled transactions, months, payees and transactions, importing transactions, bulk approval, and transaction updates/deletion.
- Added split-transaction category exposure and improved budget summaries.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** all tool names now carry the `ynab_` prefix; clients must update tool references.
- **Breaking:** upgraded to Zod 4 and MCP SDK 1.30; integrations should verify schemas and SDK compatibility.
- **Breaking:** transaction creation now supports (and may resolve) account/category names, while monetary inputs and outputs consistently use plain currency amounts rather than milliunits.
- **Breaking:** the remote Worker requires Cloudflare and GitHub OAuth configuration; local stdio remains available.
- Improved error handling so failures are returned consistently through the protocol.

### Fixed
- Excluded transfers from spending reports and categorization reminders.
- npm publishing now uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) and staged publishing: the maintainer reviews with `npm stage list` and promotes with `npm stage approve` (2FA). The package does not become public until approval.
- Categorization reminders now focus on the current month and run at a randomized hour.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-03-26

### Added
- New `ApproveTransaction` tool for approving existing transactions in YNAB
  - Can approve/unapprove transactions by ID
  - Works in conjunction with GetUnapprovedTransactions tool
  - Preserves existing transaction data when updating approval status
- Added Cursor rules for YNAB API development
  - New `.cursor/rules/ynabapi.mdc` file
  - Provides guidance for working with YNAB types and API endpoints
  - Helps maintain consistency in tool development

### Changed
- Updated project structure documentation to include `.cursor/rules` directory
- Enhanced README with documentation for the new ApproveTransaction tool
